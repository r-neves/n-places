N Places is a Progressive Web App that allows you to see places that you stored on Notion databases. These places can be visualized on a map and filtered by different attributes. 

This app is not a Google Maps "killer", it simply does a better job at showing and filtering the places you want to keep, using Notion as a low usage database.

## Running the app locally

```
npm run dev
```

## Requirements

- The app uses Notion as the data source, therefore it requires an [integration Notion API Key](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration) to access it.
- A list of database ids (see [finding the database id](https://developers.notion.com/reference/retrieve-a-database)) need to be configured on the settings. In the app, each database is identified as a category of places to be displayed (e.g. restaurants, bars, etc). All databases need to have a [configured connection](https://developers.notion.com/docs/working-with-databases#adding-pages-to-a-database) so that the API has permissions to access them.
- The databases need to follow the appropiate schema to be parsable by the app. A more readable DB schema will be provided in the future.
- This app envisioned to be managed by a closed group. The app implements Google SSO to check if the email is authorized to manage app internals such as editing ratings. The roles of logged in users are defined in a Notion database as well. If the user is not present in the table, the assigned role by default is `viewer`. Without designs for a login area, at the moment the login button is hidden as a secret click location. Can you find it? ðŸ¥š

## Roadmap
- âœ… Cache the DB results in Redis by DB last updated timestamp
- [ ] Include filters by different attributes
- [ ] Support multiple databases to show places aside from restaurants (e.g. bars, shops, etc)
- [ ] Allow the admin/moderator to edit a place rating
- [ ] Allow the user to submit a new place just by pasting the google maps link or clicking on the share button on google maps

## Design Decisions
- The app was created as a Progressive Web App to accelerate development. If there are important native features that need to be used for the app, the development will transition to a mobile framework like Flutter or React Native.
- The app uses OpenStreetMaps to render a map and avoid unnecessary API costs
- The project uses Notion as a toy database, it's not a reliable tool for efficient querying. To reduce wait time, a Redis cache (behind Vercel KV) is available as an opt-in resource by providing the.
